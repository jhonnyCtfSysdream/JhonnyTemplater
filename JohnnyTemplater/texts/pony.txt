Hello everyone!
I'm so excited to share my love for ponies with you as a dedicated blogger. My name is Luc,
and ever since I was a little kid, I've been captivated by these adorable and fascinating creatures.

This blog is my little piece of paradise where I can recount my adventures, provide tips, and share incredible stories
about the world of ponies.
